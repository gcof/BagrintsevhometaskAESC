    "### Deep crossentropy method\n",
    "\n",
    "By this moment you should have got enough score on [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0) to consider it solved (see the link). It's time to upload the result and get to something harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* if you have any trouble with CartPole-v0 and feel stuck, feel free to ask us or your peers for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "* __2.1__ __(5 pts)__ Pick one of environments: MountainCar-v0 or LunarLander-v2.\n",
    "  * For MountainCar, get average reward of __at least -150__\n",
    "  * For LunarLander, get average reward of __at least +50__\n",
    "\n",
    "See the tips section below, it's kinda important.\n",
    "__Note:__ If your agent is below the target score, you'll still get most of the points depending on the result, so don't be afraid to submit it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* __2.2__ __(bonus: 5 pts each)__ Devise a way to speed up training at least 2x against the default version\n",
    "  * Obvious improvement: use [joblib](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=joblib&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)\n",
    "  * Try re-using samples from 3-5 last iterations when computing threshold and training\n",
    "  * Experiment with amount of training iterations and learning rate of the neural network (see params), show graphs for different params\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "* Gym page: [mountaincar](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0), [lunarlander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2)\n",
    "* Sessions for MountainCar may last for 10k+ ticks. Make sure ```t_max``` param is at least 10k.\n",
    " * Also it may be a good idea to cut rewards via \">\" and not \">=\". If 90% of your sessions get reward of -10k and 20% are better, than if you use percentile 20% as threshold, R >= threshold __fails cut off bad sessions__ whule R > threshold works alright.\n",
    "* _issue with gym_: Some versions of gym limit game time by 200 ticks. This will prevent cem training in most cases. Make sure your agent is able to play for the specified __t_max__, and if it isn't, try `env = gym.make(\"MountainCar-v0\").env` or otherwise get rid of TimeLimit wrapper.\n",
    "* If you use old _swig_ lib for LunarLander-v2, you may get an error. See this [issue](https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/100) for solution.\n",
    "* If it won't train it's a good idea to plot reward distribution and record sessions: they may give you some clue. \n",
    "* 20-neuron network is probably not enough, feel free to experiment."
